<!--
    HTML RULES:
    HTML documents HTML5 <!doctype html>
    Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.
    [Optional] Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).
-->
<!--
    CSS RULES:
    The code does not have trailing white spaces.
    Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
    Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
    The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.
    Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.
    Code always uses a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block. Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
    Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
    Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).
