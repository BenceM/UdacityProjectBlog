                    It was more in compliance with the affection of my heart, than as thinking it in the least necessary, that I detained you so long in my last. Your fortitude wants not to be animated by any exhortations of mine; and, indeed, I am in every respect too much distressed myself, to be capable of encouraging another. But whatever reason there might or might not have been for the length of my former letter, I am sure it may well excuse me from extending my present, nothing new having since occurred: for as to the various and contradictory reports, which are every day propagated amongst us, concerning affairs in Spain, I imagine they are spread likewise into your part of the world. They will all terminate, however, in the same fatal catastrophe ; a catastrophe which I no less clearly discern (and I am well assured it is equally visible to yourself,) than if it were now actually before my view. 'Tis true no one can determine what will be the event of the approaching battle; but as to that of the war iu general, I have no manner of doubt, at least none with respect to its consequences; for one side or the other must certainly be victorious,<q>I am well convinced</q>of the use that either party will make of their success ; such an use, indeed, that I had rather suffer what is generally esteemed the most terrible of all evils, than live to be a spectator of so dreadful a scene. Yes, my friend, life, upon the terms on which we must then endure it, would be the completion of human misery; whereas death was never considered by any wise man as an evil, even to the happy themselves. But you are in a city where the very walls will inspire you with these, and other reflections of the same tendency, in a far more efficacious manner than I can suggest them. * I will only, therefore, assure you, (unsubstantial as the consolation is which arises from the misfortunes of others,) that you are at present in no greater danger than any of those of the same party, who have either totally renounced the war, or who are still in arms, as they are both under equal apprehensions from the victor. But there is another and far higher consolation, which I hope is your support, as it certainly is mine: for so long as I shall preserve my innocence, I will never whilst I exist be anxiously disturbed at any event that may happen ; and if I should cease to exist, all sensibility must cease with me. But I am again returning to my unnecessary reflections, and, in the language of the old proverb, am " sending owls to Athens". To put an end to them, be assured that the welfare of yourself and family, together with the success of all your concerns, is my great and principal care, and shall continue to be so to the end of my days. Farewell.
